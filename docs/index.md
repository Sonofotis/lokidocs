## Information is Important
Privacy is having the agency to decide when you reveal personal information. It is a particularly valuable quality today, when the collection and storage of personal data is taking place at unprecedented levels in history.

Loki provides the means to transact and communicate privately and anonymously, using the decentralised nature of blockchain technology to create new methods of interacting with the internet.

Loki is a private cryptocurrency based on Monero. Over the course of the coming months, the Loki project aims to offer an incenvised full node layer with a secondary p2p network that offers a private communications layer based on the Tor protocol.

More information on the project can be found on the [website](https://www.loki.network) and in the [whitepaper](https://loki.network/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/EnglishV3Whitepaper.pdf).

Loki is an open source project, and we encourage contributions from anyone with something to offer. For more information on contributing, please contact team@loki.network
