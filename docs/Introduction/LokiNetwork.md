# Loki Network

## Wallets
Wallets offer a gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. They allow you to hold, secure and trade Loki with peers. [Download an official Loki wallet](https://loki.network/getting-started/) today and start taking back control of your online privacy.

## Mining
Mining on the Loki Network is the process of solving a difficult computational puzzle through a Proof-of-Work(PoW) protocol and compiling newly created transactions into a block. Miners do this in order to earn money from the [Block Reward](/Advanced/Cryptoeconomics/#block-reward) and the fees associated from the transactions they include in each block. 

The Loki cryptocurrency can be mined using the CryptoNight Heavy hashing algorithm, which is designed to be [ASIC Resistant](../Mining/ASICResistance.md).

## Service Nodes

>> Beef up

>>Loki utilises a network of [Service Nodes](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md) who are paid to propagate the blockchain, process transactions, [route traffic](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) and [messages](../LokiServices/Messenger.md) on [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md).

## Lokinet

Lokinet is a new type of mixnet that uses market-based [Sybil attack resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md) and [onion routing](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) to create a new way to privately access the [internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KzH_eyX99A&t=2m48s). Users of Lokinet will be able to access normal websites and [SNApps](../Lokinet/SNApps.md) without revealing their IP address.

SNApps are traditional web applications that sit inside Lokinet and are hidden from the rest of the internet. The hostâ€™s IP is never revealed, therefore SNApps provide great protection for the development of censorship resistant social media, marketplaces, information sharing sites, and other apps that depend on user and server anonymity.
