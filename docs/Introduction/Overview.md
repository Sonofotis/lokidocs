## Wallets
The [Loki wallets](../Wallets/WalletsOverview.md) offer a gateway to private decentralised 
transactions and communications. It allows you to hold and secure Loki, mine and trade peer-to-peer. [Download the official Loki wallet](https://loki.network/getting-started/) today and start taking back control of your online privacy.

To learn more about Wallets [click here](../Wallets/WalletsOverview.md).

- [Web Wallet](../Wallets/WebWallet/WebWalletOverview.md): The quickest way to access a Loki Wallet is through a web based wallet, [Loki Locker](https://lokilocker.com/).

- [Graphical User Interface Wallet (GUI)](../Wallets/GuiWallet/GUIOverview.md): The Gui Wallet is just as easy to use however requires you to download the latest release from [Loki Projects Github](https://github.com/loki-project/loki-gui/releases).  

- [Command Line Interface Wallet (CLI)](../Wallets/CliWallet/CLIOverview.md): The [Cli Wallet](https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases) is for more advanced users and offers the most tools when interacting with the Loki Blockchain... and feels the most badass.

## Mining
Mining is the process of solving a difficult computational puzzle through a [Proof-of-Work(PoW)](../Mining/ProofOfWork.md) protocol and compiling newly created transactions into a block to win a Block Reward and the fees associated with the transactions compiled. 

The Loki cryptocurrency can be mined through the CryptoNight Heavy hashing algorithm, which is innately [ASIC Resistant](../Mining/ASICResistance.md). 

The following are useful guides or resources for Mining:

- [Proof of Work (PoW)](../Mining/ProofOfWork.md): Information on Proof of Work.
- [ASIC Resistance](../Mining/ASICResistance.md): How Loki is ASIC resistant.


## Service Nodes
The Loki cryptocurrency creates a network of [Service Nodes](../ServiceNodes/SNOverview.md) who are paid to propagate the blockchain, process transactions, and [route traffic](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) and [messages](../Lokinet/Messenger.md) on [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md).

## Lokinet

[Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md) is a new type of mixnet that uses market-based [Sybil attack resistance](../Advanced/SybilResistance.md) and [onion routing](../Lokinet/LLARP.md) to create a new private tunnel to the [internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KzH_eyX99A&t=2m48s). Users of Lokinet will be able to access normal websites and SNApps without revealing their IP address.

[SNApps](../Lokinet/SNapps.md) are traditional web applications that sit inside [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md). As the hostâ€™s IP is never revealed, this provides great protection for the development of censorship resistant social media, marketplaces, information sharing sites, and other apps that depend on user and server anonymity.

The first Loki service to be developed and deployed on the Loki network will be a decentralised, end-to-end encrypted private messaging application called [Loki Messenger](../Lokinet/Messenger.md).

The following are useful guides or resources for [Lokinet](../Lokinet/LokinetOverview.md):
