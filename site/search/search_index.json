On Linux and OS X \u00b6 Install the dependencies Change to the root of the source code directory and build: cd loki make Optional : If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable parallel build by running make -j<number of threads> instead of make . For this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM available per thread. Note : If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing zmq.hpp from https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to /usr/local/include should fix that error.

On Windows: \u00b6 Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within MSYS2 environment . The MSYS2 environment emulates a POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and cross-compiles binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows application. Preparing the build environment Download and install the MSYS2 installer , either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system. Open the MSYS shell via the MSYS2 Shell shortcut Update packages using pacman: pacman -Syuu Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4 Edit the properties for the MSYS2 Shell shortcut changing \"msys2_shell.bat\" to \"msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64\" for 64-bit builds or \"msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32\" for 32-bit builds Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman: pacman -Syuu Install dependencies: To build for 64-bit Windows: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium To build for 32-bit Windows: pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium Open the MingW shell via MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell shortcut on 64-bit Windows or MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells. Building If you are on a 64-bit system, run: make release-static-win64 If you are on a 32-bit system, run: make release-static-win32 The resulting executables can be found in build/release/bin On FreeBSD: \u00b6 The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Linux above. If you are running loki in a jail you need to add the flag: allow.sysvipc=1 to your jail configuration, otherwise lmdb will throw the error message: Failed to open lmdb environment: Function not implemented . On OpenBSD: \u00b6 OpenBSD < 6.2 \u00b6 This has been tested on OpenBSD 5.8. You will need to add a few packages to your system. pkg_add db cmake gcc gcc-libs g++ miniupnpc gtest . The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set. The Boost package has a bug that will prevent librpc.a from building correctly. In order to fix this, you will have to Build boost yourself from scratch. Follow the directions here (under \"Building Boost\"): https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md You will have to add the serialization, date_time, and regex modules to Boost when building as they are needed by Loki.

To run in foreground: ./bin/lokid To list all available options, run ./bin/lokid --help . Options can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the --config-file argument. To specify an option in the configuration file, add a line with the syntax argumentname=value , where argumentname is the name of the argument without the leading dashes, for example log-level=1 .

Uint64 last_uptime_proof Unix epoch timestamp of the last time this daemon has received a ping from the queried service node. Contribution[] contributors An array consisting of all the addresses that have contributed to the queried service node. Uint64 Contribution.amount The amount of Loki in atomic units the contributor has staked. Uint64 Contribution.reserved The amount of Loki in atomic units the contributor has reserved and must fulfill to completely contribute their part to the service node. Amount is equal to reserved once the contributor has fully contributed their part. String Contribution.address The Loki address that funds must come from to fulfill the contribution requirement. Uint64 total_contributed The total Loki currently contributed going towards the staking requirement. Uint64 total_reserved The total Loki that has been reserved by all contributors. The remaining Loki is open for other contributors to increase their stake towards the service node. Uint64 portions_for_operator The operator cut expressed as a value from 0 -> STAKING_PORTIONS (defined in loki/src/cryptonote_config.h) which is the fee taken from the service node reward and given to the operator address before rewards are distributed to the contributors. Uint64 operator_address The wallet address which is the primary owner of the service node and also the address which the operator cut is sent to.","title":"Outputs"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/","text":"Sybil Resistance \u00b6","title":"Sybil Resistance"},{"location":"Advanced/SybilResistance/#sybil-resistance","text":"","title":"Sybil Resistance"},{"location":"Advanced/TechnicalSpecs/","text":"","title":"Technical Specs"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingLokiNET/","text":"Using LokiNET \u00b6 // TODO: overview for lokinet cli guide --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation). --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0 to bind to just the lokinet tun interface // TODO: note which version of lokid has --p2p-bind-ifname option Example command line to start lokid for JUST lokinet traffic lokid --no-igd --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0","title":"Using LokiNET"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingLokiNET/#using-lokinet","text":"// TODO: overview for lokinet cli guide --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation). --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0 to bind to just the lokinet tun interface // TODO: note which version of lokid has --p2p-bind-ifname option Example command line to start lokid for JUST lokinet traffic lokid --no-igd --p2p-bind-ifname=lokitun0","title":"Using LokiNET"},{"location":"Advanced/UsingTor/","text":"Using Tor \u00b6 While Loki isn't made to integrate with Tor, it can be used wrapped with torsocks, by setting the following configuration parameters and environment variables: --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 on the command line or p2p-bind-ip=127.0.0.1 in lokid.conf to disable listening for connections on external interfaces. --no-igd on the command line or no-igd=1 in lokid.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation), which is pointless with Tor.

If submission proves to be vulnerable with PoC code / exploit, proceed to next step b. If not vulnerable: i. DA responds with reasons why submission is not a vulnerability ii. DA moves discussion to a new or existing ticket on GitHub if necessary DA Establishes severity of vulnerability: a. HIGH: impacts network as a whole, has potential to break entire Loki network, or service nodes, could result in the loss of Loki. b. MEDIUM: impacts individual nodes, routers, wallets, or must be carefully exploited c. LOW: is not easily exploitable or is low impact d. If there are any disputes regarding bug severity, the Loki Foundation will ultimately define bug severity Respond according to the severity of the vulnerability: a. HIGH severities must be notified on website and reddit /r/LokiProject within 3 working days of classification i. The notification should list appropriate steps for users to take, if any ii. The notification must not include any details that could suggest an exploitation path iii. The latter takes precedence over the former b. MEDIUM and HIGH severities will require a Point Release c. LOW severities will be addressed in the next Regular Release DA and Loki project team will apply appropriate patch(es) a. DA designates a PRIVATE git \"hotfix branch\" to work in b. Patches are reviewed with the researcher c. Any messages associated with PUBLIC commits during the time of review should not make reference to the security nature of the PRIVATE branch or its commits d. Vulnerability announcement is drafted i. Include the severity of the vulnerability ii. Include all vulnerable systems/apps/code iii. Include solutions (if any) if patch cannot be applied e. Release date is discussed At release date, DA coordinates with developers to finalize update: a. Response Manager propagates the \"hotfix branch\" to trunk b. Response Manager includes vulnerability announcement draft in release notes c. Proceed with the Point or Regular Release 3. Post-release disclosure process \u00b6 The DA has 90 days to fulfill all points within section 2 If the Incident Response process in section 2 is successfully completed: a. Researcher decides whether or not to opt out of receiving name/handle/organization credit. By default, the researcher will receive name/handle/organization credit. i. If bounty is applicable, release bounty to the researcher as defined in section \"Bounty Distribution\" b. Finalize vulnerability announcement draft and include the following: i. Project name and URL ii. Versions known to be affected iii. Versions known to be not affected (for example, the vulnerable code was introduced in a recent version, and older versions are therefore unaffected) iv. Versions not checked v. Type of vulnerability and its impact vi. If already obtained or applicable, a CVE-ID vii. The planned, coordinated release date viii. Mitigating factors (for example, the vulnerability is only exposed in uncommon, non-default configurations) ix. Workarounds (configuration changes users can make to reduce their exposure to the vulnerability) x. If applicable, credits to the original reporter c. Release finalized vulnerability announcement on website and reddit e. If applicable, developers request a CVE-ID i. The commit that applied the fix is made reference too in a future commit and includes a CVE-ID If the Incident Response process in section 2 is not successfully completed: a. DA and developers organize a meeting to discuss why/what points in section 2 were not resolved and how the team can resolve them in the future c. If disputes arise about whether or when to disclose information about a vulnerability, the DA will publicly discuss the issue via IRC and attempt to reach consensus d. If consensus on a timely disclosure is not met (no later than 90 days), the researcher (after 90 days) has every right to expose the vulnerability to the public 4.

It may contain errors. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! This guide will help you set up the Loki daemon (lokid) as a service. By doing this, the Loki daemon will automatically start after a crash or reboot, which helps your Service Node keep running without undesired interruptions. This guide details the process of managing the Loki daemon as a regular system process rather than in a screen session. This guide has been tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04 Read the guide carefully. You must change file path of your Loki daemon and username wherever needed. It is also recommended that you avoid running your Service Node as root user. Follow Full Guide on Service Nodes - Set up Non-root User for directions on how to create a new user for this purpose. Be careful if your server is already running as you will have to move your Loki binaries folder and .loki hidden folder, where your Service Node public key is stored, from root's home path to your new user's home path. You can read Jagerman's guide if you need a more in depth approach. Table of Contents \u00b6 Configuring the Loki daemon as a service for the first time How to update Loki binaries when running daemon as a service How to access Loki daemon in interactive mode when running daemon as a service Configuring the Loki daemon as a service for the first time \u00b6 Connect to your server via SSH (as is explained at Full Guide on Service Nodes - Step 2 - Prepare your Server ) and copy & paste the following commands into the terminal window: Create the lokid.service file: sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/lokid.service Change the file permissions: sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/lokid.service Start editing the created empty file: sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lokid.service Copy the text between the #s below and paste it into your empty file. ########################################################################################### [Unit] Description=lokid service After=network-online.target [Service] Type=simple User=YOUR_USERNAME ExecStart=/home/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER/lokid --non-interactive --service-node Restart=always RestartSec=30s [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target ########################################################################################### Modify YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER in the text that is between #s. You must change YOUR_USERNAME on two different places and YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER in one. If you are running your Service Node as root, /home must be removed from ExecStart path: ExecStart=/root/YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER/lokid --non-interactive --service-node For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of your modified ExecStart line. Once completed save and quit nano: CTRL+X -> Y -> ENTER Reload systemd manager configuration: sudo systemctl daemon-reload Stop the Loki daemon if it's running (see NOTE ). Here you have to go into the screen session where you are running lokid and type: exit + ENTER Start lokid.service: sudo systemctl start lokid.service Enable lokid.service so that it starts automatically upon boot: sudo systemctl enable lokid.service Now, everything should be working. We won't have a Loki daemon interactive screen but we can use RPC to communicate with the service. The following commands should let us know if everything went fine: Test 1. Check lokid.service status: systemctl status lokid.service Test 2. Check the Service Node status (remember to replace YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER with your own): ~/YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER/./lokid print_sn_status ( ~ character replaces user's home directory full path, do not skip it!). For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of the command. Your Loki daemon should start as a service on every reboot. How to update Loki binaries when running daemon as a service \u00b6 To update your Loki node, a process like the one found at Full Guide on Service Nodes - Updating loki can be followed. The main inconvenience of this method is that lokid.service file has to be edited on every update as the Loki daemon file path is changed. So we are forced to run several additional steps that are otherwise unnecessary. Because of this, two Loki daemon updating methods are described below: - Method based on \"Full Guide on Service Nodes - Updating loki\" - Updating Loki binaries without editing lokid.service file method Method based on \"Full Guide on Service Nodes - Updating loki\" \u00b6 Connect to your server via SSH and: Find the latest binary version, for example 1.0.4 . Check https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/latest . Stop the Loki daemon service: sudo systemctl stop lokid.service (see NOTE ) Run an update on your machine (Linux based systems): sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade Download and unzip the latest binary: wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/download/v<VERSION>/loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip and unzip loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip (replace <VERSION> with the one found on step 1, 1.0.4 in our example). Re-run steps 3 and 5 described in the previous section in order to change YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER to loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> (replace <VERSION> with the one found on step 1, 1.0.4 in our example). Re-run steps from 6 to 9 described in the previous section . You can skip step 8 as your Loki daemon should not be running at this point. The following commands should let us know if everything went fine: Test 1. Check lokid.service status: systemctl status lokid.service Test 2. Check the Service Node status: ~/loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>/./lokid print_sn_status (replace <VERSION> with the one found on step 1, 1.0.4 in our example).. For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of the command. Updating Loki binaries without editing lokid.service file method \u00b6 If you do not want to edit your lokid.service file on every update, connect to your server via SSH and follow these alternative steps: Stop the Loki daemon service: sudo systemctl stop lokid.service (see NOTE ) Run an update on your machine (Linux based systems): sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade If your Loki binaries' folder name still looks like loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> then: Rename it to loki to prevent the need of creating a new folder on every update: mv ~/loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> ~/loki (remember to replace loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> with your Loki binaries' folder name). Re-run steps 3 and 5 described in the previous section in order to change YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER to loki . Re-run steps 6 and 7 described in the previous section . Find the latest binary version, for example 1.0.4 . Check https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/latest . Download the latest binary: wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/download/v<VERSION>/loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip (replace <VERSION> with the one found on step 4, 1.0.4 in our example). Unzip the latest binary in ~/loki folder (replace <VERSION> with the one found on step 4, 1.0.4 in our example): If you want to be asked for confirmation everytime a file is going to be overwritten: unzip loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip -d ~/loki If you do not want to be asked, force overwriting: unzip -o loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip -d ~/loki Start lokid.service: sudo systemctl start lokid.service The following commands should let us know if everything went fine: Test 1. Check lokid.service status: systemctl status lokid.service Test 2. Check the Service Node status (remember to replace YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER with your own): ~/loki/./lokid print_sn_status ( ~ character replaces user's home directory full path, do not skip it!). For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of the command. Test 3. Check what Loki daemon version is running now that this information is not in its folder's name: ~/loki/./lokid version . For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of the command. Skip step 3 in future updates. How to access Loki daemon in interactive mode when running daemon as a service \u00b6 Whenever you want to access lokid in interactive mode, for example to run Service Node registration command, you have to connect to your server via SSH and: Stop the Loki daemon service: sudo systemctl stop lokid.service (see NOTE ) Start lokid from shell: ~/YOUR_LOKI_FILES_FOLDER/./lokid ( ~ character replaces user's home directory full path, do not skip it!). For Testnet, append the --testnet flag at the end of the command. Run the commands you need. For instance: prepare_registration if you are registering your Service Node. Quit lokid by typing: exit + ENTER Start the service again: sudo systemctl start lokid.service NOTE: \u00b6 If you have not updated your Loki binary files to the latest version yet you are encouraged to, since 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 users can run into timing issues that lead to deregistration with multiple consecutive daemon restarts.","title":"Service Node As Service Guide"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/RunServiceNodeAsService/#how-to-configure-the-loki-daemon-as-a-service","text":"IMPORTANT : This guide is a work in progress that may be updated.

If that isn\u2019t what you want to do, syntax and server set up will of course differ according to whatever OS you choose to run your Service Node from. Summary of Loki Service Node Requirements \u00b6 Full summary of Loki Service Node Requirements.

For now, all you need to know is that: Service Nodes are full nodes on the Loki network Full nodes become Service Nodes when the owner locks the required amount of Loki for 30 days (2 days on testnet) and submits a registration transaction Once accepted by the network, the Service Node is eligible to win block rewards Multiple participants can be involved in one Service Node and can have the reward automatically distributed It is also worth noting that Service Nodes are quite basic at the moment, and operators will need to stay up to date with new updates to keep in line with software and hardware requirements. Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also: Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions (Blink) Act as remote nodes for users Once these features come out, Service Node operation will require better servers, particularly when it comes to bandwidth. For the purposes of this guide, however, we will only consider the current requirements. New User Guide \u00b6 This section of this guide is for new users to servers and the CLI interface. Step 1 - Get a Server \u00b6 Righto! Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds for 30 days (2 days for testnet) at a time, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ) A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months. Hosting Provider Product Name Cost Per Month $USD Bandwidth Provided Exit Friendliness Rating Netcup VPS 1000 G8 10.50 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Online.net Start-2-S-SSD 13.99 15 - 17 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Scaleway START1-M 9.33 20 - 25 MiB\u2019s 7 / 10 OVH VPS SSD 2 7.61 10 - 15 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Leaseweb Virtual Server XL 34.45 30 - 35 MiB\u2019s 5 / 10 Digital Ocean 2 GB, 2 vCPUs 15 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Feral Hosting Neon Capability 19.68 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 9 / 10 Trabia VDS-8G 38.54 9 - 11 MiB\u2019s 8 / 10 Hetzner EX41-SSD (30 TB) 39.71 80 - 40 MiB\u2019s 4 / 10 Try not to pick the first one off the list. Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, what your budget is, and what the latency is like for you based on the server location that you choose. When selecting your VPS\u2019 operating system, choose Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit or Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit if you want to follow this guide. If you feel more confident or wish to run your server on another distribution or operating system, the Loki commands in this guide will still apply. Step 2 - Prepare your Server \u00b6 Every provider has a slightly different way of issuing you access to your new VPS. Most will send an email with the IP address, root username, and a root password of the VPS. To access your server, you will need a SSH client for your operating system. Because we\u2019re on Windows today, we\u2019ll download PuTTY, Mac users can also use PuTTY. If you\u2019re a Linux user, you probably don\u2019t want us telling you where to get a SSH client from. To connect to our VPS we will need to paste the IP address into the SSH client\u2019s \u201cHost Name (or IP address)\u201d input box and click the \u201cOpen\u201d button. The Port number can usually just be left as 22 . A terminal window will now appear prompting for your log-in details, username(root) and password, which were provided by your VPS provider. When entering your password, nothing will visually appear in the terminal. This is normal. Hit enter when it\u2019s typed or pasted, and you should be logged in to your VPS. Hot Tips for using the Console \u00b6 Consoles don't work like the rest of your computer. Here are some basic tips for navigating your way around the command line! Don't try copying something by using the usual Ctrl + C hotkey! If you want to copy something, do so by highlighting text and then right clicking it. Pasting works by right clicking a blank area in the console. If you want to kill a process or stop something from running, press Ctrl + C. This is why you shouldn't try copying something with this hotkey ;) You can always check the directory you are in and its contents by typing ls You can always return to your home directory by typing cd ~ You can move into a given directory by typing cd <name> or move back up one level by typing cd .. PuTTY allows you to easily duplicate or restart a session by right clicking the top of the window. Handy if you\u2019re trying to do a few things at once. Once we have logged in correctly to the VPS for the first time, the terminal may prompt us for a new password for our root account. The terminal will require you to enter the new password twice before we can start running commands. Optional - Set up Non-root User \u00b6 Best practice when running a public server is to not run your software as the root user. Although it is optional, we will create a non-root user to our VPS by running the following command. sudo adduser <username> Replacing <username> with a name you will log-in with. For this user-guide we will use snode as our username. sudo adduser snode The terminal will prompt you for a new password for our newly created user. Use a different password to the root password. Once the password has been set, the terminal will prompt for a few details about the individual running the user. You can hit enter through each of the inputs as the details are not important for the purposes of running a Service Node. Once that\u2019s done, run the following two commands to give our new account admin privileges and to change to such account. sudo usermod -aG sudo snode su - snode Before we proceed further, it is advised to close your terminal and reopen PuTTY to set up a saved session with our snode user. Your SSH client will have a load and save session function. For PuTTY we will need to type in our VPS IP address again, on the same screen type snode under \u201cSaved Session\u201d. Click on \u201cData\u201d under the drop-down menu \u201cConnection\u201d, and type in snode (or your username defined before) into the input box \u201cAuto-login username\u201d. Go back to your session screen, where we entered the IP address, and click \u201cSave\u201d. You can load this session whenever you want to check on your Service Node. Server Preparation Continued \u00b6 We should update our package lists, the below command downloads the package lists from the repositories and \"updates\" them to get information on the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. It will do this for all repositories and PPAs. sudo apt-get update You will notice a bunch of package lists were downloaded, once this is complete run the below command to fetch new versions of any packages we currently have installed on the system. sudo apt-get upgrade You will be prompted to authorise the use of disk space, type y and enter to authorise. If you are prompted at any time that a version of any file is available then click the up and down arrows until you are hovering over install the package maintainer\u2019s version and click enter. Alright, good to go. Our server is now set up, up to date, and is not running in root. On to the fun part! Step 3 - Download the Loki Binaries \u00b6 First download the Linux binaries by running the following command: wget <link> Where <link> is the download link of the latest linux release. To find the link go to https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/latest , right click the latest linux release and click Copy Link Location . Your command should look something like: wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/download/1.0.3/loki-linux-x64-1.0.3.zip If wget is not installed you may need to run sudo apt-get install wget To get to the binaries, we need to unzip them. Download and install unzip by running the following command. sudo apt-get install unzip If unzip is not installed you may need to run sudo apt-get install unzip To unzip the downloaded zip file run the following command: unzip loki-linux-x64-1.0.3.zip You should see 8 files unzipped: loki-blockchain-export loki-wallet-cli loki-blockchain-usage lokid loki-blockchain-blackball loki-wallet-rpc loki-blockchain-import Loki-gen-trusted-multisig Check they are unzipped by running: ls If not, sometimes unzip will dump the binaries in a folder. In our case the folder would be called loki-linux-x64-1.0.3 , so to get into it we can type: cd loki-linux-x64-1.0.3 To check that they are in that folder, once again, type: ls Excellent! We now have all of the necessary files to get this show on the road! NOTE: If you\u2019re nervous about trusting the binaries or the link, you should build it from source yourself. Instructions for that can be found in the README of https://github.com/loki-project/loki Step 4 - Run the Service Node Daemon \u00b6 Let\u2019s start up the daemon so we can sync the blockchain and register our Service Node. The problem with the terminal we currently have open is that once we close PuTTY the program running inside it will also shut down. We can run a program called screen which can keep our Service Node running for 30 days without having to look at it all the time. The screen command is generally included in Ubuntu by default. If it isn\u2019t, run sudo apt install screen . Running it opens up a terminal shell inside your session that will continue to run in the background once you detach it from the session. Type the following command: screen Enter through the information that the terminal shell is providing until we get back a blank screen awaiting an input. To begin the Service Node daemon we must launch lokid with the flag --service-node . ./lokid --service-node If you are testing the daemon on testnet run the following command ./lokid --service-node --testnet The daemon will now start syncing. You won\u2019t be able to do much if it hasn\u2019t synced. To have the daemon to continue to run in the background hold Ctrl and type ad. To test your screen is still running in the background run the command screen -ls and take note of the port number at the start of the screen. This number will help us re-enter the daemon at future times. Typing screen -x <port number> will reattach the session so we can see what\u2019s going on inside. Hold CTRL and type \"ad\" again to detach the screen once more. For now, we can just leave the session open to see the daemon messages while we set up the Service Node. Just don't forget to use CTRL + A + D to detach the session before you close PuTTY later on. Step 5 - Get/Open A Wallet \u00b6 While we wait for the daemon to sync, we can now get a wallet going. You do not have to run this wallet on the server and you should not! Download the software and run it from elsewhere for security reasons! You can run the CLI wallet (Command Line Interface wallet) on any other computer, including your home computer to avoid leaving your wallet on the server. However, if you do want to run the CLI wallet on another computer, you will either need to run another daemon on that local machine or use a remote node (uk.loki.cash:22020, for example). There is also a list of trusted remote nodes in the Loki Project Discord channel under #links-and-resources. Alternatively if your Service Node is synced up, you could actually use the address of that daemon. When you run 'loki-wallet-cli' locally and wish to use a remote daemon, use the syntax: ./loki-wallet-cli --daemon-address <insert address here> Or on windows: loki-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <insert address here> If you are made of money and are willing to take the small risk of losing all of your funds, you can continue running the wallet inside the Service Node VPS. So we don't have to talk about a myriad of other operating systems or potential user cases, the rest of this guide will assume you are running the wallet in the same VPS. As such, it\u2019ll probably save us time to open a second PuTTY session. You can do this by right clicking the window of the current PuTTY session and clicking \u201cDuplicate Session.\u201d Log in to your non-root user that we set up before, in our case snode, and once in we should open a new screen by typing screen and hitting return twice. Change directory to where our binaries are saved: cd loki-linux-x64-1.0.3 Then to launch the wallet run the command: ./loki-wallet-cli If you are on testnet run the command with the --testnet flag: ./loki-wallet-cli --testnet When loki-wallet-cli first runs, it will request for you to specify a wallet name. Assuming we haven't created one yet, we will use the e.g. name MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the client will prompt us to create a new wallet. Type y and click return to continue. The loki-wallet-cli has generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password. Note: - When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character you type including if it is capitalised or lowercase. - Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. - Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing in 1 and clicking return. The CLI will generate and spit out several lines of text. The first two lines of text show your wallet public address. This address can be shared, will be used to receive Loki to your wallet, and will be used during the preparation and registration of our Service Node. All Mainnet Loki public addresses start with an L and are followed with a string of characters, Testnet Public addresses start with a T. The public address shown will be your primary address, however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. Line 13 to 17 show your 25-word mnemonic (\u201cnew-monic\u201d) seed. The seed is used to easily backup and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper, and write down your 25 words in order. Store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place, if your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your wallet. It is at this point that we should get some Loki in the wallet. The amount of Loki required to run a node is derived from the function shown in Lokis Cryptoeconomic paper . Don't worry if you cant work out the formula, you can use this community created tool or, the daemon will display the amount of Loki required to run the node. If you do not have enough you will have the option to join in or run your own Service Node pool. If you are running a Service Node on the testnet you will only ever require 100 testnet Loki to run the Node. You can ask someone in the Loki Discord Community for some testnet Loki, or alternatively you can run the command start_mining in your wallet. This may take an hour or two to get enough Loki. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet We will need our address to register our Service Node later, to get your primary address type the following command: address Highlight the string of characters that were outputted and save this in a notepad for later use, your public address should look similar to: LPoiZQ43qG18FzKq7WhEbk3gfNNiemGsd7REdSQaFv4RdB8E97RxP8WFLRR2xHQStiSM61EFEicXU3EEPj7GEHdz8WHUrWRkbGeQ1r8ro8 NOTE: Do not use CTRL + C to copy your address, it will close the wallet down. Simply highlight the address and this will automatically save the portion you highlighted into your clipboard. Once you have enough Loki in this wallet, just leave it open, we\u2019ll come back to it in a minute. Step 6 - Service Node Registration \u00b6 The next part of the guide will split into two sections: If you are an individual staker and do not require any other contributors to run your Service Node jump into 6.1 - individual Staking . If you want to run a pooled Service Node or contribute towards a pool jump into 6.2 - Pool Staking 6.1 - Individual Staking \u00b6 If you want to run the Service Node as an individual you will require the following things. A Loki daemon running with --service-node flag (see step 4). A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in your account to meet the Service Node Staking Requirement (see step 5). Now if we have the two above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Type screen -ls to get a list of the screens running. Your daemon will normally be the bottom one on the list. To enter our daemon run the following command, replacing <port number> with the number that corresponds with your daemon. screen -x <port number> To start the registration process we are going to run the following interactive command within the daemon terminal: prepare_registration The daemon will output the current staking requirement and prompt you with an input to clarify if you are an individual staker or you will be running a pool. Type y and click enter as we will be the sole staker. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your Loki Address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address. Double check the address matches the one of your wallet then click enter if it is the same. The daemon will now ask if you wish to enable automatic re-staking. Type y and click enter if you would like to have your Service Node re-stake automatically for you at the end of every 30 days. Type n if you would like to re-stake manually. The daemon will now ask for a final confirmation, if you agree to the information provided type y and click enter. The daemon will output a command for us to run looking similar to: register_service_node 4294967292 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 4294967292 100.000000000 1535677391 ec3895ea70a4a91b5ec4b5e1df96a45e07046f1fb0123c754d98fb2d70f4529d 5bb35d7b8ab1acb943bc47913ada8f9d2e6d6e22264e57484a04c1bbfd461f0ee2e5435454cd9b7059b221eb506ce9ea4537ddd9faf1f1757e0ef611a41c0609 Copy the whole line of text and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . if registering multiple nodes, please wait at least 10 blocks between Service Nodes before running the register Service Node command in the wallet You have 2 weeks from the moment of registering the Service Node to run the register_service_node command, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. We do not require our daemon terminal anymore, however we do need to daemon to be running. Hold CTRL and type ad to detach the screen. Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet. Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node. Alternatively, you can also include the auto command, this will create a wallet which runs as a background process and automatically signs a register transaction each 30 days, so the contributor need not sign a new transaction manually each registration period. register_service_node auto args..... If you run the auto command the wallet will close pushing the process into the background. See additional information at the end of this guide to learn how to stop the auto command. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Well done! Let's continue to the next step \"Step 7 - Service Node Check\" to check if our Service Node is running. 6.2 - Pool Staking \u00b6 Service Nodes can be split between multiple parties. At a minimum, the operator must stake at least 25% of the total required amount. The operator can also reserve contribution slots for specific addresses to prevent random users from adding to the pool. In any given pool, there will be at most 4 contributors including the operator. After the operator, each new participant must also contribute 25% of the minimum, except the last one. So for example, valid splits might be: Operator Contributor 1 Contributor 2 Contributor 3 25% 25% 40% 10% 65% 25% 10% 90% 10% 99% 1% Depending on the individual and their circumstance they will need to: Jump into section \"6.2.1 - Operator\" if they are running the daemon and hosting the pool; Jump into section \"6.2.2 - Pool Contributor\" if they are contributing to someone's Service Node. NOTE: It is advised to read both sections of \"6.2 - Pool Staking\" to have a better understanding of the process. 6.2.1 - Operator \u00b6 The Operator is the individual who will be hosting the pool and running the Service Node daemon, thus incurring the operating expenses encompassed by running a node. The Operator will need to have: A Loki daemon running with --service-node flag (see step 4) at all times. A loki-wallet-cli primary address with enough Loki in their account to meet 25% of the Staking Requirement. 1-3 other contributors who also have a loki-wallet-cli with enough Loki in their accounts to meet 25% of the staking requirement. The address and contribution amounts the 1-3 contributors will stake. NOTE: The other contributors addresses are optional to have as you can create your pool to be open to anyone to contribute to, however they are recommended to have to avoid any issues of other individuals stealing their spots. Now if we have the three/four above items we can proceed to our daemon to register our Service Node. Type screen -ls to get a list of the screens running. Your daemon will normally be the bottom one on the list. To enter our daemon run the following command, replacing <port number> with the number that corresponds with your daemon: screen -x <port number> To start the registration process we are going to run the following interactive command within the daemon terminal: prepare_registration The terminal will prompt the operator to specify if they will contribute the entire stake, because we are running this as a pooled Service Node we will type n and click enter. Next the terminal will request the input for the operator cut. This value is between 0-100 and represents the percentage of the reward the operator will receive before the reward is distributor to the share holders. If you have agreed to a 10% operator cut with the other contributors you would type 10 and click return. The terminal will now display the minimum reserve the operator can contribute and request the operator to input the amount in Loki they wish to contribute. Type your desired <operator contribution> and click return. Once we have set the operators desired stake amount we have the option to either leave the pool open for anyone to contribute or lock a reserve for individuals that have agreed with us to stake within our Service Node. Reserved Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to have their pool closed they should type y and click continue. The terminal will now prompt the operator for the number of additional contributors they have organised to be apart of this Service Node. They must type in the number of contributors, not including themselves, and click return. The daemon will now prompt us for the Loki address of the operator. If you followed step 5 you should have this address saved in a notepad, if not run through step 5 again to find your address. Once we have the Loki Address copied to our clipboard we can then right click the terminal screen to paste the address then click return to confirm your address. Next the operator must input each of the contributors amount of Loki they will stake and each contributors address. The daemon will now ask if you wish to enable automatic re-staking. Type y and hit return if you would like to have your Service Node re-stake automatically at the end of every 30 days. Type n if you would like to re-stake manually. You will now be asked to confirm the information above is correct. Open Pool \u00b6 If the operator wishes to leave their pool open they should type n and click continue. The terminal will prompt the operator to input their address. Once the address has been inputted the terminal will display the remaining portion that needs to be contributed by others. If you agree click y and hit return. The daemon will display a summary of the information we entered. This is our chance for a final check over to make sure we entered in the right information. If you confirm the information is correct type y and click return. The daemon will output a command for us to run within our wallet, looking similar to: register_service_node 214748364 T6UCEoWvJHCJq5biK3LMQZ4CRXAaqiPda2kCRRYYYEMFfxYoqnUo7Nx88RL3wmENwN4kfjDSp2jMN1g6PSErKrSu2EEp8UMy5 1073741823 T6TCCyDgjjbddtzwNGryRJ5HntgGYvqZTagBb2mtHhn7WWz7i5JDeqhFiHqu7ret56411ZJS7Thfeis718bVteBZ2UA6Y7G2d 3221225469 25.000000000 1535692249 5dac247e90ced2dcd9e51faec8792acb0c11b4c700640d9104b17c868ea167e3 cc11eef804c11d3e93cf8c488c10d97b8cec9ee2b38e6666ff07749c2911aa06ce310edc926a4d2f50a588e9c15afcc20e935a0f188aa7caa764a62058dec80d NOTE: You must run the command outputed in your daemon and not the command shown above. Copy the whole line of text in your daemon and paste it into your notepad as we will need to run this command in our loki-wallet-cli . You have 2 weeks from the moment of registering the Service Node to run the register_service_node command, however it is advised to do it as soon as possible. Before we leave the daemon run the following command to get our <Service Node Public Key> and save it in your notepad: print_sn_key Run through step 5 once more to open our Loki wallet. Once we are in our wallet run the command the daemon outputted for us when we prepared our Service Node. The wallet will prompt us to confirm our password, then the amount of Loki to stake. Confirm this by typing y and clicking enter. Alternatively, the operator can also include the auto command, when staking this will create a wallet which runs as a background process and automatically signs a register transaction each 30 days, so the contributor need not sign a new transaction manually each registration period. register_service_node auto args..... If you run the auto command the wallet will close pushing the process into the background. See additional information at the end of this guide to learn how to stop the auto command. We must now send the <Service Node Public Key> to our contributors with the amount of Loki they are required to stake. At this point the we will need to wait until all contributors have staked before rewards will be received. 6.2.2 - Pool Contributor \u00b6 The pool contributor must first receive the Service Node Pubkey and the requirements (amount of loki to send) from the Service Node Operator. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet The pool contributor must have downloaded the necessary binaries, is running a daemon or is connected to a remote node, has generated a wallet through the loki-wallet-cli , and has enough Loki to stake. They can then run the following command in their loki-wallet-cli . stake <Service Node Pubkey> <address> <contribution amount> Where the <Service Node Pubkey> is the Pubkey provided from the Service Node operator, the <address> the service node operator will likely reserve an address for which they want you to stake for, this will usually be the same address as the wallet you are planning to stake from, in the case of an open pool this will always be the address you will you stake from and you will also receive rewards here too. <contribution amount> is the amount of Loki they are going to stake which they agreed to with the Service Node Operator. The Pool Contributor can also include the auto command, when staking this will create a wallet which runs as a background process and automatically signs a register transaction each 30 days, so the contributor need not sign a new transaction manually each registration period. stake auto <Service Node Pubkey> <address> <contribution amount> If you run the auto command the wallet will close pushing the process into the background. See additional information at the end of this guide to learn how to stop autostaking. The auto command does not work with a multsig wallet as there is a requirement for the party who is staking to have the transaction signed by another signer. Thus is it advised if you are using a multisig wallet to maintain the staking once a month when the funds are unlocked. At this stage you will need to wait for the other contributors to provide their collateral. Once everyone has staked you can refer to \u201cStep 7 - Service Node Check\u201d to see where your Service Node Operator\u2019s node is in the list. Congratulations, you are now staking. Step 7 - Service Node Check \u00b6 After we have locked your collateral we will need to check if our Service Node Pubkey is sitting in the list with the other Service Node\u2019s on the network. This will prove our Service Node is running, recognised and will receive a reward if it keeps running. Let\u2019s go into our daemon screen by typing screen -x <port number> . To find the port number use screen -ls and your daemon should be sitting at the bottom of the list. Once we are in the daemon again we can run the following command to see our Service Node Public Key: print_sn_key The Service Node Public Key is used to identify our Service Node within the list of Service Nodes currently on the network. You can jump onto https://lokiblocks.com/ to see if your Service Node is in the list or we can continue in the terminal to output the same information. If you are running your Service Node on testnet go to https://lokitestnet.com/ instead. We will want to know the current block height, type status into the daemon and it will output this information. Once we have the block height we can then check the current Service Nodes on the network at our specified block height. Run the command print_quorum_state <block height> replacing <block height> with the number minus 1 that was outputted when running status command. If your <Service Node Pubkey> is sitting in the list you know you are now staking. Additional Functions \u00b6 Autostaking - Checking/stopping autostake command \u00b6 To check the processes running in the background, run the command: top -u <username> Under the COMMAND column we should see a process called loki-wallet-cli . If you do not see this process you are either looking at the wrong <username> or your autostake command is not running. If you want to stop the autostake then run the following command while logged on to the specific <username> which has loki-wallet-cli running in the background: pkill loki-wallet-cli ### Running Autostake on startup If the host machine your VPS is running on shuts down or restarts unexpectedly then so to will your your autostaking wallet, you can use the following command to start the autostaking wallet again, you can also include these commands in your startup scripts, ensuring if your node goes down it automatically restarts the wallet process. loki-wallet-cli --testnet --wallet-file <PATH TO WALLET FILE> --password <WALLET PASSWORD> set ask-password 0 register_service_node auto ... Running this command if you have already staked will not stake over the top of an already staked node Express Setup Guide \u00b6 This section is for power users who are more familiar with servers and the CLI interface. There's a couple of things your going to want to do before you commence. 1. Get a Server that meets requirements 2. Run the Daemon on a server from a non-root user account, then stake from a local wallet (or a wallet on a separate server). where <VERSION> is mentioned replace with the latest version , example 1.0.3 3. Connect via SSH to your server 4. add new user sudo adduser snode <enter> Y exit 5. login to your new user account via SSH snode@<ipaddress> 6. Update necessary security patches and system utilities sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade 7. Download & unzip Loki wget https://github.com/loki-project/loki/releases/download/v<VERSION>/loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip sudo apt-get install unzip unzip loki-linux-x64-<VERSION>.zip 8. Run Loki in a screen and Detach Screen <enter> cd loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> ./lokid --service-node Ctrl +AD Wait for the Loki Daemon sync the blockchain (1 - 8 Hours depending on internet speed) 9. Open a Wallet This wallet can be in a screen on the Service Node machine, or a wallet on your local computer (assuming you have downloaded the binaries). cd loki-linux-x64-<VERSION> Linux/MAC - ./loki-wallet-cli Windows - loki-wallet-cli Enter Name: Name your wallet Enter password Language: 1 (for English) Securely store: 1. Address 2. Seed Phrase 3. Pass-phrase Send enough Loki to fund a node, wait for Balance to be unlocked (20 mins, 10 confirmations) 10. Register your Service Node On your Service Node reattach to the screen which has the Service Node running. screen -r prepare_registration Contribute entire Stake: Y/N Enter Loki Address Enable Restaking: Y/N Confirm: Y Copy green registration message Ctrl +AD 11. Reattach to Service Node or local wallet Paste in registration message <enter> 12 Attach Back to Service Node Daemon screen -r print_sn_key Copy service node key, and search for it on: https://lokiblocks.com/service_nodes CTRL +AD ctrl +ad detaches screen and runs your Loki Service Node in background this is critical Conclusion \u00b6 Well done!

Once all of the updates are out, Service Nodes will also: Route end user\u2019s internet traffic, either as an exit node or relay in a novel mixnet Receive, store and forward encrypted user messages Monitor other Service Nodes and vote on their performance Be called into quorums which give them authority over instant transactions (Blink) Act as remote nodes for users Once these features come out, Service Node operation will require better servers, particularly when it comes to bandwidth.

Let\u2019s get started. Choosing where to set up a Service Node is the biggest choice you will make when running a Service Node. There are a number of things to consider. Because you will be locking up funds for 30 days (2 days for testnet) at a time, you will want to ensure that your server has: A stable, relatively fast connection to be able to respond to ping requests to avoid being booted off the network We recommend 2GB of RAM to cope with running the software reliably ( Note: This requirement may be much greater once services are live ). 1GB is fine for testing. At Least a 20GB SSD or Hard disk drive, this will be used to store the blockchain ( Note: to future proof yourself against blockchain growth and message storage we recommend a 30 - 40 GB drive ) A stable power supply. If your server goes down during the staking period, you may get kicked off the network, and not receive rewards while your funds are still locked for the remainder of the staking period. For most users, we assume that your home internet connection is relatively slow (< 4MB/s down and up) and probably lacks support for external connections. If this is the case, you will probably not want to run a Service Node from your home in the long term, as this could cost you if and when you get booted off. Since we\u2019re just testing at the moment, you could run it from home anyway, but for this guide we\u2019ll avoid it. Typically, the easiest and cheapest way to host a server outside of your home is to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS). There are thousands of options when it comes to VPS providers, but for now, just about any one will do. In the future, selection will be made more difficult because most providers will not allow exit node traffic, so we have compiled a list of exit node friendly providers to choose from if you want to stay with your provider for more than a few months.

Do some digging and see which one looks the best to you, what your budget is, and what the latency is like for you based on the server location that you choose. When selecting your VPS\u2019 operating system, choose Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit or Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit if you want to follow this guide.

The problem with the terminal we currently have open is that once we close PuTTY the program running inside it will also shut down. We can run a program called screen which can keep our Service Node running for 30 days without having to look at it all the time. The screen command is generally included in Ubuntu by default. If it isn\u2019t, run sudo apt install screen . Running it opens up a terminal shell inside your session that will continue to run in the background once you detach it from the session. Type the following command: screen Enter through the information that the terminal shell is providing until we get back a blank screen awaiting an input. To begin the Service Node daemon we must launch lokid with the flag --service-node . ./lokid --service-node If you are testing the daemon on testnet run the following command ./lokid --service-node --testnet The daemon will now start syncing. You won\u2019t be able to do much if it hasn\u2019t synced. To have the daemon to continue to run in the background hold Ctrl and type ad. To test your screen is still running in the background run the command screen -ls and take note of the port number at the start of the screen. This number will help us re-enter the daemon at future times. Typing screen -x <port number> will reattach the session so we can see what\u2019s going on inside. Hold CTRL and type \"ad\" again to detach the screen once more. For now, we can just leave the session open to see the daemon messages while we set up the Service Node. Just don't forget to use CTRL + A + D to detach the session before you close PuTTY later on.","title":"Step 4 - Run the Service Node Daemon"},{"location":"ServiceNodes/SNFullGuide/#step-5-getopen-a-wallet","text":"While we wait for the daemon to sync, we can now get a wallet going. You do not have to run this wallet on the server and you should not! Download the software and run it from elsewhere for security reasons! You can run the CLI wallet (Command Line Interface wallet) on any other computer, including your home computer to avoid leaving your wallet on the server. However, if you do want to run the CLI wallet on another computer, you will either need to run another daemon on that local machine or use a remote node (uk.loki.cash:22020, for example). There is also a list of trusted remote nodes in the Loki Project Discord channel under #links-and-resources. Alternatively if your Service Node is synced up, you could actually use the address of that daemon. When you run 'loki-wallet-cli' locally and wish to use a remote daemon, use the syntax: ./loki-wallet-cli --daemon-address <insert address here> Or on windows: loki-wallet-cli.exe --daemon-address <insert address here> If you are made of money and are willing to take the small risk of losing all of your funds, you can continue running the wallet inside the Service Node VPS. So we don't have to talk about a myriad of other operating systems or potential user cases, the rest of this guide will assume you are running the wallet in the same VPS. As such, it\u2019ll probably save us time to open a second PuTTY session. You can do this by right clicking the window of the current PuTTY session and clicking \u201cDuplicate Session.\u201d Log in to your non-root user that we set up before, in our case snode, and once in we should open a new screen by typing screen and hitting return twice. Change directory to where our binaries are saved: cd loki-linux-x64-1.0.3 Then to launch the wallet run the command: ./loki-wallet-cli If you are on testnet run the command with the --testnet flag: ./loki-wallet-cli --testnet When loki-wallet-cli first runs, it will request for you to specify a wallet name. Assuming we haven't created one yet, we will use the e.g. name MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the client will prompt us to create a new wallet. Type y and click return to continue. The loki-wallet-cli has generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password. Note: - When typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character you type including if it is capitalised or lowercase. - Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. - Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing in 1 and clicking return. The CLI will generate and spit out several lines of text. The first two lines of text show your wallet public address. This address can be shared, will be used to receive Loki to your wallet, and will be used during the preparation and registration of our Service Node. All Mainnet Loki public addresses start with an L and are followed with a string of characters, Testnet Public addresses start with a T. The public address shown will be your primary address, however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. Line 13 to 17 show your 25-word mnemonic (\u201cnew-monic\u201d) seed. The seed is used to easily backup and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper, and write down your 25 words in order. Store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place, if your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your wallet. It is at this point that we should get some Loki in the wallet. The amount of Loki required to run a node is derived from the function shown in Lokis Cryptoeconomic paper . Don't worry if you cant work out the formula, you can use this community created tool or, the daemon will display the amount of Loki required to run the node. If you do not have enough you will have the option to join in or run your own Service Node pool. If you are running a Service Node on the testnet you will only ever require 100 testnet Loki to run the Node. You can ask someone in the Loki Discord Community for some testnet Loki, or alternatively you can run the command start_mining in your wallet. This may take an hour or two to get enough Loki. If you are staking please do not use Subaddresses. They are currently unsupported by the Loki wallet We will need our address to register our Service Node later, to get your primary address type the following command: address Highlight the string of characters that were outputted and save this in a notepad for later use, your public address should look similar to: LPoiZQ43qG18FzKq7WhEbk3gfNNiemGsd7REdSQaFv4RdB8E97RxP8WFLRR2xHQStiSM61EFEicXU3EEPj7GEHdz8WHUrWRkbGeQ1r8ro8 NOTE: Do not use CTRL + C to copy your address, it will close the wallet down. Simply highlight the address and this will automatically save the portion you highlighted into your clipboard.

It is best to use a brand-new wallet for the purpose, although not required. It is strongly advised to make a copy of the wallet files first, just in case something goes wrong. Overview \u00b6 In short, the process is: Set-up Both parties prepare loki-wallet-cli files Both parties command prepare_multisig and send data to each other Both parties command make_multisig Receiving All parties can type address to see the created multisig wallet address. The address will, of course, be the same for all parties since they're all watching the same wallet. Preparation for Sending To prepare for sending both parties command export_multisig_info <filename> and send the file to the other party To complete preparation, all parties command import_multisig_info <filename1> <filename2> and import files from other parties Sending To send, any party can use the usual transfer command, but the result will be a file named multisig_loki_tx which must be sent to any 1 other signer The other party commands sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and the file is updated with the signature. The completely signed file is pushed to the network with use of submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx Below is a step-by-step walkthrough. Set-up \u00b6 Step 1 Initiate Creation of Multisig Wallet and Exchange Data \u00b6 Requirements: 2 empty loki-wallet-cli wallets Both wallets connected to lokid Private communication channel Person A must run the command in their loki-wallet-cli : prepare_multisig Person A will receive the output: MultisigV1cYuTGuf8FSiCYnMtLU4sZzeKZgeMy51qf4CcG2EQ2BPqKTii6YanpNLJDTM9rVRNfBPNFnJHoCWwGT9d8kB2UEDNHDxjgaAZX6DAWtj9VBFq9Q5qHjduozaYzgYpbVfHKHUQR2UrJjyX7tCSyd8gFEHUSocDRejRZBrFrKNifri5ozpN Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Copy the entire line Multisig...5ozpN and be sure to capture the whole thing when copying. Send this line to person B through a private communication channel. Person B does the same and sends his output to person A. Person B must run the command in their loki-wallet-cli : prepare_multisig Person B will receive the output: MultisigV1BU9w9mysQMhNTYcNFQgD82VQiKFGpkwy8Jmu13iWWBmoeRbqyuYmEh22bJRk945ntuDeazTsYwUCYZcCL1cxuf4xDzwUJCLkiYhPCvF7gv3xrCGkAiozirNUG6CxRa53mHqp4Cvdj3yxcQcYbXNYC1ecybbQMW1gs5BBQiruVGeJi4FS Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Person B will copy the Multisig\u2026...eJi4FS and send it to person A through a private communication channel. Step 2 Create Multisig Wallets \u00b6 Both person A and person B now have the Multisig...arg text from the other one. With that, each of them can create their part of the multisig wallet. Before you proceed, note that the wallet will lose access to the underlying account when converted to multisig. This is not really a problem, since we started with an empty one, and if all goes ok with this step, you won't ever need it unless you want to go through the process again for whatever reason (like HDD died, but you have the seed mnemonic of the underlying account and want to reconstruct the multisig wallet). Person A will use the output Person B sent and will run the command: make_multisig 2 MultisigV1BU9w9mysQMhNTYcNFQgD82VQiKFGpkwy8Jmu13iWWBmoeRbqyuYmEh22bJRk945ntuDeazTsYwUCYZcCL1cxuf4xDzwUJCLkiYhPCvF7gv3xrCGkAiozirNUG6CxRa53mHqp4Cvdj3yxcQcYbXNYC1ecybbQMW1gs5BBQiruVGeJi4FS The wallet will output something similar to: 2/2 multisig address: T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8 Person B will use the output Person A sent and run the command: make_multisig 2 MultisigV1cYuTGuf8FSiCYnMtLU4sZzeKZgeMy51qf4CcG2EQ2BPqKTii6YanpNLJDTM9rVRNfBPNFnJHoCWwGT9d8kB2UEDNHDxjgaAZX6DAWtj9VBFq9Q5qHjduozaYzgYpbVfHKHUQR2UrJjyX7tCSyd8gFEHUSocDRejRZBrFrKNifri5ozpN The wallet will output something similar to: 2/2 multisig address: T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8 Now each person involved should exchange addresses and compare, they must be the same. Receiving \u00b6 Step 1 Fund The Multisig Account \u00b6 This is simple. Just send to the shared address. You can send multiple times, this is the same as a normal wallet. You can use payment ID\u2019s as well, or generate an integrated address to receive funds. Best part, whomever is sending the funds won't be able to tell that the address belongs to a multisig wallet since it looks like any other. Step 2 Check Multisig Account Balance \u00b6 Just open the wallet and command refresh. Once completed, both persons can verify that the funds arrived. Person A commands: show_transfers Person A outputs: 1357156 in 07:50:35 PM 0.100000000000 88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873 0000000000000000 - 1357161 in 08:00:18 PM 0.100000000000 d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da 0000000000000000 - Person B can do the same: show_tranfers Person B has the same outputs: 1357156 in 07:50:35 PM 0.100000000000 88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873 0000000000000000 - 1357161 in 08:00:18 PM 0.100000000000 d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da 0000000000000000 - Spending \u00b6 Step 1 Synchronizing Key Images \u00b6 1.1 Exporting Multisig Info \u00b6 Without this step, it will not be possible to create a spending transaction. Both persons need to run the following command to sync their key images: export_multisig_info <filename> Where <filename> can be any filename. Person A will run the command: export_multisig_info mi1 Person A will receive the output: Multisig info exported to mi1 The file mi1 will be located in the shell working folder* Person A sends that file to Person B. They can send the file in many ways, preferably through by handing a usb drive with the file on it, however If you would like to send the file through terminal use https://transfer.sh/ , an optional step has been added if you choose to use this method. Person B does the same, but changing the filename and runs the command: export_multisig_info mi2 Person B will receive the output: Multisig info exported to mi2 The file mi2 will be located in the shell working folder* Person B sends that file to person A. Now, they must both import each other's file. Optional: Step 1.2 Sending Multisig Info File with terminal - transfer.sh \u00b6 It is optional to use the terminal to send each person the multisig info files. Uploading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person A will open up a new terminal and change to the directory \u201cmi1\u201d has been saved.* Person A will run the following command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi1 Person A will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 Person A will need to send this link to Person B. Person B will run a similar command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi2 Person B will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 Person B will need to send this link to Person A. Downloading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person A should change to the directory of their loki-wallet-cli and use Person B\u2019s download link to run the command: curl <Person B link> -o <filename> Replacing <Person B link> with the link Person B shared with Person A and <filename> with the filename of the Multisig info file that Person A generated, for example Person A will run the command: curl https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 -o mi2 Likewise, Person B should do the same, changing directories to their loki-wallet-cli and downloading with Person A\u2019s download link, and filename. curl https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 -o mi1 Step 1.3 Importing Multisig Info \u00b6 Person A will run the command: import_multisig_info mi2 Depending on the transactions made in to the multsig wallet the output will look similar to: 2 outputs found in mi2 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Person B will run a similar command: import_multisig_info mi1 and the output will look like: 2 outputs found in mi1 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Step 2 Preparing Spending Transaction \u00b6 Either person A or person B can do this, it doesn't matter. To avoid weird things from happening only do it for 1 transaction at a time. Person A performs the usual transfer command: transfer T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 50 The output will look like*: Unsigned transaction(s) successfully written to file: multisig_loki_tx Check in the folder where you started loki-wallet-cli from*. There should be a file named multisig_loki_tx . Person A will send the file multisig_loki_tx to the Person B. Person A can send this file through email or alternatively use the transfer.sh commands outside of the wallet: curl --upload-file ./multisig_loki_tx https://transfer.sh/multisig_loki_tx If Person A chooses to use transfer.sh command to send the file to Person B they will receive a <link> to pass to Person B. Person B must finish the signature. Person B copies/downloads the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli *. Person B can run the command to download the file to the loki-wallet-cli directory. curl https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx -o multisig_loki_tx Replacing https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx with the link provided by Person A. Then, Person B runs the command: sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx A prompt will be displayed to allow person B to check the transaction before signing: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID. Is this okay? (Y/Yes/N/No): If ok, answer Y , and the output will look like: Transaction successfully signed to file multisig_loki_tx, txid 3b03b16c79eaa5564171ae88242c4cdb1f9e0b41fc3de949c6524c5026a3f3bb It may be relayed to the network with submit_multisig Finally, person B submits the transaction to the network by commanding: submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx There will be a confirmation prompt: Loaded 1 transactions, for 108.082287779, fee 0.061108880, sending 50.000000000 to T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7, 58.021178899 change to T6ScXhWpAG2aUHmFemwvn4HddHA5GQ4u6MvYsW2hVteJSwLJXCEhk2aVp4XzyqGmvyUqc3w8fwWwg6szGEytUSx51C6WQ3er8, with min ring size 10, no payment ID. Is this okay? (Y/Yes/N/No): If ok, answer Y , and the transaction will be sent. The output will look like: Transaction successfully submitted, transaction <3b03b16c79eaa5564171ae88242c4cdb1f9e0b41fc3de949c6524c5026a3f3bb> The person B could also send the signed TX to person A, who could then submit it to the network himself. If you want to make another one, you have to go back to step 1 of spending (sync the key images again). *Note on folders and file locations, as it could create some confusions. The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki-windows-x64\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

If you want to make another one, you have to go back to step 1 of spending (sync the key images again). *Note on folders and file locations, as it could create some confusions. The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki-windows-x64\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki-windows-x64\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

It is best to use a brand-new wallet for the purpose, although not required. It is strongly advised to make a copy of the wallet files first, just in case something goes wrong. Overview \u00b6 In short, the process is: Wallet Creation All parties command prepare_multisig and send data to ALL other parties All parties command make_multisig <threshold> <data1> <data2> and send 2nd batch of data to ALL other parties All parties command finalize_multisig <data1> <data2> with the data from ALL other parties. Receiving All parties can type address to see the created multisig wallet address. The address will, of course, be the same for all parties since they're all watching the same wallet. Preparation for Sending To prepare for sending all parties command export_multisig_info <filename> and send the file to all other parties To complete preparation, all parties command import_multisig_info <filename1> <filename2> and import files from other parties Sending To send, any party can use the usual transfer command, but the result will be a file named multisig_loki_tx which must be sent to any 1 other signer The other party commands sign_multisig multisig_loki_tx and the file is updated with the signature. The completely signed file is pushed to the network with use of submit_multisig multisig_loki_tx . Below is a step-by-step walkthrough. Wallet Creation \u00b6 Requirements: 3 empty loki-wallet-cli wallets All parties wallets connected to a lokid Private communication channel Step 1 - Prepare Multisig \u00b6 Here some data will be shown to the user, which has to be exchanged with ALL other parties. Person 1, 2 and 3 commands: prepare_multisig The output will be something like: MultisigV1cR7X7ZAfa5ncRmQv1hpt4P1DmmnhinhokhDMqsmuWXmHFrb6xUr3FtBGygCfMScxnKJvXK1vvPNahXNWfYWVquieBErr98sFtgs24c2YuYrQT78uxV8oYx1A9bKeHSUfYzCniN5kMznEfvKCw3FiomjLvw364gg98ZWp16zA7pUVozid Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use make_multisig <threshold> <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info This includes the PRIVATE view key, so needs to be disclosed only to that multisig wallet's participants Copy the entire line Multisig\u2026...Vozid and be sure to capture the whole thing when copying. Person 1 to send the Multsig...arg to Person 2 and 3, Person 2 to send their output to Person 1 and 3 and Person 3 to send their output to Person 1 and 2. Step 2 - Make Multisig \u00b6 All 3 persons now have the Multisig...arg text from the other 2. With that, each of them can create their part of the multisig wallet. Before you proceed, note that the wallet will lose access to the underlying wallet when converted to multisig. This is not really a problem, since we started with an empty wallet, and if all goes OK with this step, you won't ever need it unless you want to go through the process again for whatever reason (like HDD died, but you have the seed mnemonic of the underlying wallet and want to reconstruct the multisig wallet). Person 1 commands: make_multisig <threshold> <data person 2> <data person 3> Where <threshold> is the number of signers required out of the 3 people, <data person 2> is the output provided by Person 2, and <data person 3> is the output provided by Person 3. This should look similar to: make_multisig 2 MultisigV12EHtuvxFyAYDNcDsbDqWHDfkRr4JZchSdf8eZQSFwiMKDk15CYEJeQyEwtSnqUZdRr2BsEaT9z2biUdDTEQM4T3N625owvKMDoyhbRj3bwkBtceLKimap8DBAiUmSABpdf62HnPYiRtLW4JdVFmfqjndhWjYBypx1duvpi3qwfSrBY9a MultisigV1TqQ8Gt5Sb3GYtVJa1fQrK7e7hPm59XbooNvLxPSBR4856bW9jtD1hEyWy4yULKrX7reZZ6vrKdBCdSdk4nfApCGYJAA2WP4pKNwHDyKTuLEeuoDhqno8keEVeEF9AZsWXvng1avUTRREmy11h8wu8pdjopC4AguQKiHCJCN7aT9W6b8C Notice how there are 2 strings starting with Multisig....arg . One is from person 2 and other from person 3. The number at the beginning is the minimum required number of signatures. Since it's a 2/3 scheme - it's 2. The output from the make_multisig command will be similar to: Another step is needed MultisigxV1PKCwmVrucV8bXi18VnHFqRXcnAq4osFL3ahzPHCiN48zhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTS8r9EX1DmVPXgFKkFzw4Yj4ZtMcJVo77b5ayuMzjFtsaijko9X2bjd9AVfFVGBFMCSLa4xXhNVNz19CTUJx5gpoPG Send this multisig info to all other participants, then use finalize_multisig <info1> [<info2>...] with others' multisig info With 2/3 there's an additional step to be done here. The new Multisig...arg info must be passed to ALL other participants (persons 2 & 3). Persons 2 & 3 do the same as above and send the info to other 2 parties. Step 3 - Finalize Multisig \u00b6 Here we do one last command to make the wallet ready for receiving. It requires the 2nd batch of Multisig\u2026....arg strings received from other parties. Person 1 will run the command: finalize_multisig MultisigxV1Vg1tsRLurvAc5aSA9Hd9God3MQhijCFoE1rPDFzx7ufwhs28u6jmEhy7ktZbUEGfRtTuFjjKzJYb61fnFwnysBBnfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmgSQ1NZLyBj48R1tVpiGNxa7TDnGbSgLuKBq35AX6jfu5PECAcDDn22CFQbJZip7xnBbn89Szzh27xeozfxcLiqqm MultisigxV14xDZBGACz3iUh2aVKGE5q5VzcvJdg2qCvZECgUWCdy5QNXsUtCgFMXPa7FyNKVy2AnUg3ePEnKqWkgKVvA81axTSfYm4xJWcJ4qM4khSb2KkyAKDuT39pTvdmemhojNjeYCmCNaRSsDEcemLLL8wCvzsy5R6hhkhWLYkD9vhZwprSFFKMZ7tfRko2VfMBoKQhB7PKXbf1npk2xceVKu2y7kExywb Unfortunately the wallet will not display an output at this point. There's no indication that the process was successfully completed (for now). All 3 persons do the same, and all 3 wallets will show the same address after this step. Now each person run the command: address And each 3 parties of the multisig wallet should be shown the same address in their wallet. Receiving \u00b6 Step 1 Fund The Multisig Account \u00b6 This is simple. Just send to the shared address. You can send multiple times, just like a normal wallet. You can use payment ID\u2019s as well, or generate an integrated address to receive funds. Best part, whomever is sending the funds won't be able to tell that the address belongs to a multisig wallet since it looks like any other Loki address. Step 2 Check Multisig Account Balance \u00b6 Just open the wallet and run the refresh command . Once completed, all persons can verify that the funds arrived. Person 1, 2 & 3 can run the command: show_transfers To see incoming transfers or the following command to see the balance of the wallet: balance Preparation for Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Export Multisig \u00b6 Without this step, it will not be possible to create a transaction that spends Loki. As a minimum, the sender needs to get a partial key image from the same person who will sign the transaction with him later. He could get from both parties immediately and then later decide with whom to sign. Person 1 commands: export_multisig_info mi1 Where mi1 can be any filename. The output will be: Multisig info exported to mi1 The file mi1 will be located in the shell working folder* Person 1 sends that file to other persons. Persons 2 & 3 do the same. Optional: Step 1.2 Sending Multisig Info File with terminal - transfer.sh \u00b6 It is optional to use the terminal to send each person the multisig info files. Uploading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 will open up a new terminal and change to the directory mi1 has been saved.* Person 1 will run the following command: curl --upload-file ./mi1 https://transfer.sh/mi1 Person 1 will receive the link to the file as an output, looking similar to: https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 Person 1 will need to send this link to Person 2 and Person 3. Person 2 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1 and 3. Person 3 will need to do the same and send the link to Person 1 and 2. Downloading Multisig Info file \u00b6 Person 1 should change to the directory of their loki-wallet-cli and use Person 2 and 3\u2019s download link to run the commands: curl <link> -o <filename> Replacing <link> with the link Person 2 and 3 shared with Person 1 and <filename> with the filename of the Multisig info file that Person 2 or 3 generated, for example Person 1 will run the command: curl https://transfer.sh/Iedv9/mi2 -o mi2 And the command: curl https://transfer.sh/dfvr3/mi3 -o mi3 Likewise, Person 2 and 3 should do the same, changing directories to their loki-wallet-cli and downloading with the alternative Persons download link, and filename. curl https://transfer.sh/Ehl5q/mi1 -o mi1 Step 2 - Import Multisig \u00b6 Now, they must all import each other's file so they can be ready to make a TX later. For example, Person 2 commands: import_multisig_info mi1 The wallet will look for files in the shell working folder* and if the files are found the output will look like: 2 outputs found in mi1 Height 1357156, transaction <88ba687dc79a0b39e6de6d0763eda8363d33d9f58ec9a096171bd9a7f1dae873>, received 0.100000000000 Height 1357161, transaction <d6ac845b9400759525519cdc5d514eb8f5b1d265b24d1c016e75b20ed3b4b7da>, received 0.100000000000 Persons 1 & 3 do the same. Spending \u00b6 Step 1 - Transfer (Preparing Unsigned Transaction) \u00b6 Any of the 3 persons can start a transaction, it doesn't matter. To avoid weird things from happening only do it for 1 transaction at a time. If anything weird happens, do the step 1 & 2 again to fix. For example, let's say that Person 3 will make the TX. Person 3 performs the usual transfer command: transfer T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 50 The output will look like: Unsigned transaction(s) successfully written to file: multisig_loki_tx Check in the folder where you started loki-wallet-cli from*. There should be a file named multisig_loki_tx . Send the file multisig_loki_tx to either person 1 or 2. Person 3 will send the file multisig_loki_tx to the Person 1 or 2. Person 3 can send this file through email or alternatively use the transfer.sh commands outside of the wallet: curl --upload-file ./multisig_loki_tx https://transfer.sh/multisig_loki_tx If Person 3 chooses to use transfer.sh command to send the file to Person 1 or 2 they will receive a <link> . Person 1 or 2 must finish the signature. Person 1 or 2 copies/downloads the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli *. Person 1 or 2 can run the command to download the file to the loki-wallet-cli directory. curl https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx -o multisig_loki_tx Replacing https://transfer.sh/CJqnM/multisig_loki_tx with the link provided by Person 3. Step 2 - Sign Multisig \u00b6 Let's say Person 2 was picked as the partner. He must finish the signature. Person 2 copies the file to the same folder from where he started (or will start) loki-wallet-cli *.

The wallet will look for the files and export them to the folder from where it was started, ie where your command prompt / shell was when you called loki-wallet-cli . It may or may not be the same folder as your actual wallet files or loki-wallet-cli , depending on how you go about it. For example, your wallet could be on some USB drive like f:\\temp\\ , and your wallet software on c:\\loki\\ and your shell working folder could be c:\\ . If you remain in c:\\ with the shell, you could start the wallet by its full path and specify the wallet file location: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file f:\\temp\\mywallet . In this case, all the import/export stuff would be read/written to c:\\ because that's still your shell's working folder. It would be probably feel more natural to cd into the wallet folder. Do f: to change drive and then cd f:\\temp\\ . Then, simply start the wallet from that location by its full path again: c:\\loki\\loki-wallet-cli.exe --wallet-file mywallet . Notice how you don't have to write the full wallet path now as you're already there with your shell. In this case, all the files mentioned above would be written or read from the same folder as the wallet files.

For example: [wallet T6TmZX]: balance Currently selected account: [0] Primary account Tag: (No tag assigned) Balance: 172286.035054991, unlocked balance: 172086.338373771 While running the command balance detail will generate a more detailed output, showing the account number, first few characters of the address, balance, unlocked balance, Outputs and the Label of the account. For example: [wallet T6TmZX]: balance detail Currently selected account: [0] Primary account Tag: (No tag assigned) Balance: 172286.035054991, unlocked balance: 172086.338373771 Balance per address: Address Balance Unlocked balance Outputs Label 0 T6TmZX 172286.035054991 172086.338373771 3347 Primary account There are other commands that will also output the balance which have been covered by this guide, such as the account command. 3 Getting the Block Height \u00b6 To show the blockchain height run the command: bc_height 4 Blackballing Transactions \u00b6 Blackballing transactions allows you to ignore others' outputs (containers of money) that are known to be spent in a certain transaction. For example let\u2019s imagine that txid: 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 is known to be fake and if this txid is seen within a RingCT transaction the network can assume it is fake, therefore an actor has a better chance of deducing the real transaction within the RingCT. By blackballing the above txid we remove the chance of it being used within our RingCT. To do this we will use the following command: blackball <output public key> | <filename> [add] For example: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackball 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 To check if the txid was added to our list of txids not to use we can use the following command: blackballed <output public key> If the txid is on our list the following will output: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackballed 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 [wallet LAXk6e]: Blackballed: <4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542> Alternatively if the txid is not on our list the following will output: [wallet LAXk6e]: blackballed 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 [wallet LAXk6e]: not blackballed: <4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542> To unblackball a txid use the following command: unblackball <output public key> For example: [wallet LAXk6e]: unblackball 4f4b371a0da8858bbeab8a40ff37de1f6ff33e64a616e5ced8239062570b7542 5 Reserve Proof \u00b6 Reserve Proofs are used to generate a signature proving that you own an amount of Loki, with the option to sign the reserve proof with a key. For example let\u2019s imagine you see a car for sale but they will accept Loki as payment, however they have advised in their online listing that they are only interested in serious buyers and require you to prove you have the Loki within your initial contact. Luckily we can use the Reserve Proof commands for this proof. 5.1 Generate Reserve Proof \u00b6 To begin we will need to run the get_reserve_proof command to generate our proof. get_reserve_proof (all|<amount>) [<message>] If the individual you are sending this proof to requires you to prove you have 1000 Loki you will need to replace the section (all|<amount>) with a 1000, otherwise replace it with the amount you need to prove you have reserved. If you want to put an extra layer of encryption over the file replace [<message>] with a password. Your command will similar to the below command: get_reserve_proof 1000 Car The Cli will request your wallet password and once your password is entered it will tell you it generated a signature file. [wallet T6TmZX]: get_reserve_proof 1000 Car Wallet password: signature file saved to: loki_reserve_proof This signature file loki_reserve_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_reserve_proof command it will overwrite your loki_reserve_proof file. You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_reserve_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_reserve_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_reserve_proof The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_reserve_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_reserve_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki address you are proving has Loki in it. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 5.2 Checking Reserve Proof \u00b6 To check a reserve proof we need to first have the loki_reserve_proof file in our Loki folder. If you do not have the loki_reserve_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_reserve_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_reserve_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_reserve_proof . Now that the loki_reserve_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_reserve_proof <address> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <address> is the address of the wallet where the command get_reserve_proof was ran. <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the reserve proof, normally generated as loki_reserve_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the reserve proof. Therefor for the previous example where we created a reserve proof for 1000 loki and signed with \u201ccar\u201d, we would run the command: check_reserve_proof T6TmZX8EzZVjS9zNg7zAsrEQFDgcVC2qV2ZMyoWsbyK4SNB2SwMHZtMhPSsFyTmRBQUaGVF5k3qy5CMFM6Lvj7gi3AeszDag7 loki_reserve_proof Car If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature -- total: 1014.862440831, spent: 0.000000000, unspent: 1014.862440831 You may note that it shows a reserve proof which is greater than 1000, this is because the command is adding up all the transactions into the address specified until it is greater than the reserve proof set. 6 Spend Proof: \u00b6 Spend Proofs are used to generate a signature proving that you generated a TXID, with the option to sign the spend proof with a key. For example let\u2019s imagine you have bought a car from a dealership with loki and have sent 1000 loki to the seller. Unfortunately the dealer does not know which transaction is yours as he has received 5 transactions of 1000 loki in the same block for 5 different cars. He knows the txid\u2019s but wants you to prove that you have generate one of the txid\u2019s in his list. Luckily we can prove we generated the txid by using the get_spend_proof command. 6.1 Generate Spend Proof \u00b6 To begin we will first need to find the txid associated with our transaction. To do this run the following command in our wallet: show_transfers The terminal will output a list of transactions in and out of your address. You should have a transaction in your list with the amount you spent to the dealership. Copy the txid(by highlighting) associated with this transaction and save it in a notepad for later. We can now run the get_spend_proof command to generate our proof. get_spend_proof <txid> [<message>] Replacing <txid> with the txid of our transfer out and replacing <message> if we want to add a password to the proof. If all went well the terminal will output the following text: signature file saved to: loki_spend_proof This signature file loki_spend_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_spend_proof command it will overwrite your loki_spend_proof file . You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_spend_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_spend_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_spend_proof The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. For example: https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_spend_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_spend_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki transaction txid associated with the transaction you are proving you generated. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 6.2 Checking Spend Proof \u00b6 To check a spend proof we need to first have the loki_spend_proof file in our Loki folder and the txid associated with the transaction being proved. If you do not have the loki_spend_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_spend_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_spend_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_spend_proof . Now that the loki_spend_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_spend_proof <txid> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <txid> is the txid associated with the transaction that is being proved. <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the spend proof, normally generated as loki_spend_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the spend proof. An example would look like the following command check_spend_proof 20eb3b5545d6587e5a379feb2fc69b43d4f8b6b825bb7eff78e263d4e7e8eaa9 loki_spend_proof car If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature If you receive a Good signature message that should be a good proof that the txid you are checking was generated from the sender. Keep in mind however that this can potentially not always be the case, considering someone could get access to someone else's computer thus having access to this file. 7 TX Proof: \u00b6 TX Proofs are used to generate a signature file proving that you generated a TXID, with the option to sign the spend proof with a key. TX proofs work similar to Reserve Proof\u2019s and Spend Proofs however they show more detailed information. For example let\u2019s imagine you have bought a car from a dealership with loki and have sent 1000 loki to the seller. Unfortunately the dealer does not know which transaction is yours as he has received 5 transactions of 1000 loki in the same block for 5 different cars. He knows the txid\u2019s but wants you to prove that you have generate one of the txid\u2019s in his list. Luckily we can prove we generated the txid by using the get_tx_proof command. 7.1 Generate Spend Proof \u00b6 To begin we will first need to find the txid associated with our transaction. To do this run the following command in our wallet: show_transfers The terminal will output a list of transactions in and out of your address. You should have a transaction in your list with the amount you spent to the dealership. Copy the txid(by highlighting) associated with this transaction and save it in a notepad for later. We can now run the get_tx_proof command to generate our proof. get_tx_proof <txid> <address> [<message>] Replacing <txid> with the txid of our transfer out, <address> with the receiver's address, and replacing <message> if we want to add a password to the proof. If all went well the terminal will output the following text: signature file saved to: loki_tx_proof This signature file loki_tx_proof will be saved in your Loki folder, where your daemon and wallet keys are. Keep in mind every time you run the get_tx_proof command it will overwrite your loki_tx_proof file. You will want to send this file to the person who requires the proof. You can upload the loki_tx_proof file through https://transfer.sh/ by running the command within the folder of your signature file: curl --upload-file ./loki_tx_proof https://transfer.sh/loki_tx_proof The terminal will then print out a link to your signature file which you can then provide to the individual performing the check. For example: https://transfer.sh/QhoC7/loki_tx_proof Make sure you provide the following to the individual who will be checking your reserve proof: The loki_tx_proof file through the transfer.sh link. The loki transaction txid associated with the transaction you are proving you generated. The receivers loki address. The <message> if you encrypted the file. 7.2 Checking tx Proof \u00b6 To check a tx proof we need to first have the loki_tx_proof file in our Loki folder, the receiver's address and the txid associated with the transaction being proved. If you do not have the loki_tx_proof file in your loki folder request the individual sending the file to you to use https://transfer.sh/ , once they send you the link to their loki_tx_proof you can use the following command to download it. curl <link> -o loki_tx_proof Replacing <link> with the link to download the loki_tx_proof . Now that the loki_tx_proof is in our folder we can run the following command: check_tx_proof <txid> <address> <signature_file> [<message>] Where <txid> is the txid associated with the transaction that is being proved, <address> is the receiver\u2019s address and <signiture_file> is the file that was received from the individual sending you the tx proof, normally generated as loki_tx_proof and <message> is the key set by the individual who sent you the tx proof. An example would look like the following command: check_tx_proof 3f8c62b4d83100ff4f89b44a96350e65aeaa83a9b4273c31f94b9aa12e713044 TRrEpWMLd3rRuirYqsjg1iaNsukAAojWjFDhJ2kK2o4uM6tkcjMerA4SZNat6QHEYe1SoGCFQddVPgRqmkA8kARX1ffU1Wcjc loki_tx_proof If all goes well, the terminal will output the following: Good signature TRrEpWMLd3rRuirYqsjg1iaNsukAAojWjFDhJ2kK2o4uM6tkcjMerA4SZNat6QHEYe1SoGCFQddVPgRqmkA8kARX1ffU1Wcjc received 40000.000000 in txid <3f8c62b4d83100ff4f89b44a96350e65aeaa83a9b4273c31f94b9aa12e713044> This transaction has 1 confirmations If you receive a Good signature message that should be a good proof that the txid you are checking was generated from the sender. Keep in mind however that this can potentially not always be the case, considering someone could get access to someone else's computer thus having access to this file. 8 TX key: \u00b6 A TX key is a private key associated with a TXid. Only the wallet that has sent the transaction can generate a TX key from the TXID that both parties can see. A TX key can be used to validate a transaction on a case by case basis. In essence, you can provide the tx key, txid and the receiver address to someone to prove you had generate that transaction. 8.1 View TX key \u00b6 To view the TX key of a specific transaction you have generate you will need to run the command: get_tx_key <txid> Where <txid> is the transaction id associated with the transfer out you are proving is yours. The terminal will prompt the user for the wallets password and then print out the tx key, which will look similar to: [wallet T6TmZX]: get_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f Wallet password: Tx key: 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e Provide the <tx key> with the <txid> and <receiving address> to the individual who will run the validation, thus this will prove you generated the transaction. 8.2 Validate transaction with TX key \u00b6 Once we have a <tx key> , <txid> and <receiving address> from a specific transaction we can use the following command to prove they are all associated: check_tx_key <txid> <txkey> <address> For the previous example we would run the following command from any loki wallet: check_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 The terminal will show text of how much Loki the address received. It will also show how many confirmations the transaction has received from the blockchain. For example: [wallet T6TZ2V]: check_tx_key d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f 5dfc4d677e2707317f306219b6aa445feaab4c652927237c012f7e72cb41bf0e T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 T6TZ2VaG1p9PQkDgdVCYwnjoxYSU7ErXX56etGsqHLugAGqynFwBvP4dnN7wvYCcJfMa9LPgtYu8UEUqyc4xsxmx2ZTyMp4U3 received 10000.000000000 in txid <d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f> This transaction has 10 confirmations 9 Tx Notes \u00b6 The loki-wallet-cli allows you to add notes to specific txid\u2019s, however this note does not get stored on the blockchain, rather it is stored on client side, on the device that generates the tx_note . 9.1 Set tx note \u00b6 To set a tx note we will need a the <txid> and the <message> you want to add to the txid. For instance, if you want to add a note to a txid that is connected to your wallet run the following command to show your transactions in/out with their <txid> \u2019s: show_transfers To set the note to the <txid> run the following command: set_tx_note <txid> [free text note] Where <txid> is the transaction id associated to the transaction you are adding the [free text note] too. Your command will look similar to the following example: [wallet T6TmZX]: set_tx_note d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f This is a tx note example. 9.2 View tx note \u00b6 To view a note connected to a txid run the following command: get_tx_note <txid> Where <txid> is the transaction id that has the note connected to it. For example, if we run the command on the previous <txid> mentioned, the terminal will display the following text: [wallet T6TmZX]: get_tx_note d5fb415aad43f4e45bc72566d5ad4c8f12629db1f924d953efc2521c137a987f note found: This is a tx note example. You can also view a tx note by running the show_transfers command, each transaction that has a note connected to it will display the text to the right of each transfer. 10 Changing wallet password \u00b6 Changing the wallet password is only client side(locally), and if the password is forgotten the wallet can always be restored with the mnemonic seed. If you know the password to the wallet and want to change it you can run the following command: password Once the command has been run the terminal will prompt you for the current password and the new password twice. If entered correctly the terminal will go back to receiving inputs, otherwise the terminal will output an error such as Passwords do not match! Please try again or Error: invalid password . 11 Encrypting seed phrase \u00b6 Your seed passphrase is a 25 word phrase which is used to recover access to your wallet on a client or gui and is. The command encrypted_seed allows your to add an additional password, or encryption layer, to your 25 word mnemonic seed. Encrypting your seed will stop others from recovering access to your wallet if they somehow gain access to your 25 word mnemonic seed as they will not have the passphrase that decrypts them. This means, your passphrase should not be written or saved in the same location as your encrypted 25 word mnemonic seed phrase. To encrypt your seed run the following command: encrypted_seed Initially the cli wallet will prompt you to enter your wallet password. Next it will request for your seed encryption passphrase, enter in your desired password/passphrase once, click enter, then type the passphrase in again. The wallet will output your mnemonic seed which is a 25 word passphrase. It is generally best practice to write these 25 words down and store them somewhere safe and securely, write your passphrase down(which is the phrase you used to encrypt the 25 words) and store this somewhere else. Storing the 25 words with the passphrase in a file on your computer that is not encrypted is giving others easier access to your mnemonic seed.","title":"CLI Wallet Commands"},{"location":"Wallets/CliWallet/WalletCommands/#commands","text":"","title":"Commands:"},{"location":"Wallets/CliWallet/WalletCommands/#displaying-commands","text":"The loki-wallet-cli has multiple commands to conduct different operations on the Loki Blockchain.

The CLI wallet only uses text to do operations, where the oki-wallet-gui wallet offers a graphical user interface with buttons to do most of the operations the loki-wallet-cli does. If you are new to console or terminal commands and/or would prefer a wallet with buttons and Loki branding we would suggest you download the latest loki-wallet-gui release from here and follow the guide found here to get started. Bear in mind that the CLI wallet, while harder to use, is generally faster and more reliable. If you are still interested in the 'Loki-wallet-cli' you can find it here . Download the latest release for your specified Operating System, for this user guide we are going to assume you are running the latest MAC OS and have XCode installed. Step 1: Opening loki-wallet-cli and lokid. \u00b6 To use the loki-wallet-cli we must first have the daemon, lokid , up and running. The lokid is your node which the loki-wallet-cli broadcasts through. Without the node running the loki-wallet-cli will not be able to operate. Open up the lokid file in the folder you extracted the release from. In most cases you will have the following security dialog box pop up. If the dialog box opens up you will need to allow the lokid to open by moving your cursor to the top-left of your screen, clicking the apple logo, and then clicking on system preferences. Once in system preferences click on the Security & Privacy button, check in this new screen that the lokid file was blocked, if it was you should be confident to click \u201cOpen Anyway\u201d. Keep clicking open and allow to give the software permission to run. Once the software has permission a terminal window should pop up and say the following text: ********************************************************************** The daemon will start synchronizing with the network. This may take a long time to complete. You can set the level of process detailization through \"set_log <level|categories>\" command, where <level> is between 0 (no details) and 4 (very verbose), or custom category based levels (eg, *:WARNING). Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. Use \"help <command>\" to see a command's documentation. ********************************************************************** Let the daemon run until the node is completely synced, you will know the node is synced once the terminal outputs the following text: ********************************************************************** You are now synchronized with the network. You may now start loki-wallet-cli. Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. ********************************************************************** Now the daemon is synced we can run the loki-wallet-cli file. Step 2: Setting up your loki-wallet-cli account. \u00b6 If this is your first time opening the loki-wallet-cli it will request for you to specify a wallet name. For the purposes of this user guide we will use the example name MyWallet Specify wallet file name (e.g., MyWallet). If the wallet doesn't exist, it will be created. Wallet file name (or Ctrl-C to quit): MyWallet Because this is the first time we have used the name MyWallet the following text will appear in our terminal. Type in Y or Yes to confirm your wallet name. No wallet found with that name. Confirm creation of new wallet named: MyWallet (Y/Yes/N/No): Yes The loki-wallet-cli has now generated us a wallet called MyWallet and is now prompting us for a password for our generated wallet. Please note: when typing the password, the characters will not appear. It will seem as if you are typing and no text is appearing however the terminal is logging every character your clicking including if it is capitalised or lowercase. Write down your wallet name and password on a piece of paper as this information will be required every time we want to enter our wallet. Use a password with uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and make the password at least 9 characters long. Generating new wallet... Enter a new password for the wallet: Confirm password: Now once we have chosen our password for the wallet we must choose our language. For the purposes of this user guide I suggest you use English by typing 1 and clicking enter. List of available languages for your wallet's seed: If your display freezes, exit blind with ^C, then run again with --use-english-language-names 0 : Deutsch 1 : English 2 : Espa\u00f1ol 3 : Fran\u00e7ais 4 : Italiano 5 : Nederlands 6 : Portugu\u00eas 7 : \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a 8 : \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e 9 : \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 (\u4e2d\u56fd) 10 : Esperanto 11 : Lojban Enter the number corresponding to the language of your choice: 1 The loki-wallet-cli will generate and spit out several lines of text. Some of the information that was outputted will only ever show once, therefore it is very important to do this next section properly otherwise we may lose access to our account, thus losing access to our funds. Let\u2019s take a close look at each section of the newly generated wallet: The text after Generated new wallet shows your public address. This address can be shared and will be used to receive Loki to your wallet. All Loki public addresses start with an L.... and are followed with a string of characters. The public address shown will be your primary address however multiple public addresses can be generated from this primary address. You do not need to write down the public address, the command address will re-display it whenever required. Generated new wallet: LAXk6eS3Ng98QxDTdC47eNdfCXttJycKraXxfsw9cMVngGUqP3kiSE6cwXoApU6gjzSXVX1ASAPAi1MSXA935XUs1MWEcv9 The View key address is not to be shared unless you want to show the transactions received to the public address connected to this wallet. You do not need to write down the view key as it can be re-displayed with the command viewkey . View key: 97d3c27e20818e5e23a6548458b50d4f128a2709c55eb7f9518d0e957a5d2e0d The next few lines of text show how to navigate the loki-wallet-client . This user guide will look into more detail the commands that can be used within the loki-wallet-client further in the guide. Your wallet has been generated! To start synchronizing with the daemon, use the \"refresh\" command. Use the \"help\" command to see the list of available commands. Use \"help <command>\" to see a command's documentation. Always use the \"exit\" command when closing loki-wallet-cli to save your current session's state. Otherwise, you might need to synchronize your wallet again (your wallet keys are NOT at risk in any case). The next section with the random 25 words is your mnemonic seed. The seed is used to easily back-up and restore your wallet without needing any other information. At this stage, grab a pen and paper and write down your 25 words in order(having these words out of order will not restore your wallet) and store the piece of paper in a safe and secure place. If your words are stored in a text file on your computer or stored online, you increase your risk of someone else getting control of your account. NOTE: the following 25 words can be used to recover access to your wallet. Write them down and store them somewhere safe and secure. Please do not store them in your email or on file storage services outside of your immediate control. ponies innocent oyster whale autumn knapsack jostle elapse inroads joining doorway ticket drying obnoxious algebra tutor biplane sack alpine zinger huge duets refer rigid inroads The last of the outputs are the account balance, because your wallet does not have any Loki in it currently the balance is showing 0. Once we receive a transaction of Loki into our wallet the balance will appear as soon as the transaction is confirmed in one block (usually less than 2 minutes). Once the transaction has been confirmed over 10 blocks the balance will show in unlocked balance. The unlocked balance is the Loki available to be spent/sent to other addresses. Starting refresh...
